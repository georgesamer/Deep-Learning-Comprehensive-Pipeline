# Deep-Learning-Comprehensive-Pipeline
A comprehensive Python framework for building neural networks from scratch and comparing them with TensorFlow/Keras. Features 5 real-world examples including Tabular classification (Diabetes), Text analysis (NLP), and automated data pipelines.
# 🚀 Neural Network Mastery: From Scratch to Production

A professional-grade implementation of neural networks, featuring custom-built architectures alongside modern deep learning frameworks. This project demonstrates the journey from understanding basic weights and biases to building a complete production-ready data pipeline.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **Custom Feed-Forward NN:** Built from scratch using NumPy with support for multiple hidden layers and activations.
* **NLP Integration:** Complete text preprocessing pipeline (Tokenization, Lemmatization, TF-IDF).
* **Keras Comparison:** Side-by-side performance evaluation between custom models and TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Automated Pipeline:** Integrated data loading, visualization, training, and report generation.
* **Comprehensive Visualization:** Automatic generation of Loss/Accuracy curves, Confusion Matrices, and Correlation Heatmaps.
